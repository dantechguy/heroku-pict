    <h3>how to play</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>you and your friends enter a four digit code above and press 'go to room'. you could also press 'random' which will generate a new room code for you.</li>
      <li>everyone needs to enter a name, once everyone has pressed 'ready' the game will continue</li>
      <li>everyone will then need to enter a prompt and press 'submit'. this is anything random, for example 'parachuting dog'</li>
      <li>these prompts are then shuffled around between users, and everyone attempts to draw their prompt, then pressing 'submit' once ready</li>
      <li>these drawings are then shuffled around between users, and all users must write what they think the drawing is, then pressing 'submit'</li>
      <li>this cycle of "drawing - writing a prompt - drawing" continues for as many rounds as there are people</li>
      <li>at the end of the game, each user receives a summary of where their drawing ended up, showing the chain reaction of events which lead to the final result</li>
